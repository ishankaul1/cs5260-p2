#Test Resource Weights
Test files that include the 'weighting' of each resource. These weights can be thought of a 'value per unit', with respect to some common currency across nations, that each resource is given when trading.
The weights should be a 'simplified' version of the country utility function if we were to represent it as a weighted sum. However, the utility function will be more complex based on real-world logic.
Some rules w.r.t the weights:
    1) Any 'waste' resource must be given a 'negative' value. They can still be traded, as we can consider that another country could get rid of some waste for us in exchange for some favors.
    2) Any resource that cannot be traded in a game world will be given a weight of 'x'. For some resources, that will be up to the 'game world' (eg - test case) creator (ex- can we really trade farms? Not really unless we literally give up the land, but we can definitely trade their products, so this is arguable). However, I will always keep Population as a non-tradeable, because the possibility of a slave trade in my game world does not sit well with me.
